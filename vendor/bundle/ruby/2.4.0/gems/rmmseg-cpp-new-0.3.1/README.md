rmmseg-cpp-new [![Gem Version][version-badge]][rubygems]
==============


Copy and rebuild the [rmmseg-cpp](https://github.com/pluskid/rmmseg-cpp): an re-implementation of rmmseg (Chinese word segmentation library for Ruby) in C++, with modern [rake-compiler](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler) and windows support.

Reason not implementing on original rmmseg-cpp see original [PR 4](https://github.com/pluskid/rmmseg-cpp/pull/4)

[PR](https://github.com/Eric-Guo/rmmseg-cpp-new/pulls) is welcome, although I'm not a native C++ developer.
